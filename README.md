# Udacity Project: Neighbourhood Map

Neighbourhood Map is a single page web application based on MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, built using the Knockout framework. It displays a Google Map of an area in Old Town Toronto and various points of interest. Users can search all included landmarks and, when selected, additional information about a landmark is presented from the Wikipedia API.
